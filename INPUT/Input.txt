Region: name of the studied area, same as the name of the main directory of data i.e., (Package/INPUT/”Region”) 
ISNet
wave-type: type of the raw ground motion data as “A” (Acceleration) or “V” (Velocity). (Default: A)
A
dirparam: specific part of the name of the SAC-formatted waveforms to make directory. (Default: *sac*)
*C00*
Unit, CF: CF is a conversion factor to change the conventional unit of amplitude to the SI 
unit i.e., m/s2 or m/s for acceleration or velocity respectively. “Unit” can be set as Yes or No
depends on existence of a unique CF value for whole data or not. (Default: No, 1)
No, 1e-9 
minSta: minimum number of stations required to make average and build up the LPDT curve at each time. (Default: 5)
3 
Rmax: maximum hypocentral distance in km to select data within, for events with different range of Magnitude: 
M<=1, 1<M<=3, 3<M<=5, and M>5. (Default: 20, 40, 60, 100)
30, 15, 15, 100
SNR: the threshold value for SNR to exclude the bad quality signals. (Default: 10)
10
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
nPol, cor1, cor2: number of poles (nPol) and two corner frequencies (cor1, cor2 in Hz) 
of the band-pass Butterworth filter applied to the displacement. (Default: 2, 1, 30)
1, 1, 50 
Vfilter, nPolV, cor1V, cor2V: number of poles (nPolV) and two corner frequencies (cor1V, cor2V in Hz) 
of the band-pass Butterworth filter applied to the velocity signals in case that “Vfilter” is set as “Yes”.(Default: No, 2, 0.075, 30)
No, 2, 0.075, 30
WinFix, WinMax, S_P_Coef: the P-waves are windowed after the onset using a fix (WinMax) or variable values for each station,
depending on what is set as the “WinFix”, i.e., “Yes” or “No” respectively. In case of selecting the variable time window, 
the S-mines-P coefficient (S_P_Coef) is then used to calculate the length of the window from the P-wave to the S-wave. 
(Default: No, 1, 0.09).
No, 1, 0.09
WinFix_fit, WinMax_fit: selecting a fix/variable time window (WinFix_fit: “Yes/No”) to fit to the LPDT curve with length of “WinMax_fit”. (Default: No, 1). 
Yes, 0.5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
rho, Vp, Vs, SD: properties of the medium i.e., density of the area (rho in kg/m3), P-wave velocity (Vp in m/s), 
S-wave velocity (Vs in m/s), and trial value of Stress Drop (SD in MPa). (Default: 2700, 5500, 3000, 1)
2700, 5500, 3200, 0.2
RadP: P-wave radiation pattern coefficient. (Default: 0.52).
0.52 
QFilter, Qp: implementing (on) or ignoring (off) the anelastic attenuation analysis. 
In case of implementing this correction, the constant Qp-value for the studied area is assumed 
to remove the anelastic attenuation from the seismograms. (Default: on, 150).
on, 226
FitFun, selecting the fit function to model the LPDT curve, among two options of “exp” or “HB”. (Default: “HB”).
HB
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SD1, SD2, SDN: range of the static stress drop in MPa from SD1 to SD2 
this interval is divided to SDN values (Approach 1)
1e-5, 100, 500
